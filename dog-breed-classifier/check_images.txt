Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the Dog_01.jpg is the image of a golden retriever.
            ALEXNET, RESNET and VGG model architectures classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be a golden retriever


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures (ALEXNET, RESNET and VGG) classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg (which is a golden retriever) to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg ( upside-down image of Dog_01.jpg )
            Dog_01: golden retriever
            Dog_02: golden retriever


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures (ALEXNET, RESNET and VGG) correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg (which is bear_01.jpeg) and Object_Name_01.jpg(which is coffee_mug_01.jpeg) to not be dogs.
            bear_01: brown bear, bruin, ursus arctos
            coffee_mug_01: cup(in ALEXNET) and coffee mug(in RESNET & VGG)


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: For the uploaded_images, I would prefer RESNET as it provides the results accurately, both the RESNET and VGG architectures perform better than ALEXNET in classifying the images.
        But on comparing the classification performed on uploaded_images and pet_images, I would say that VGG provides accurate results though it requires more time.
